# Web Development In 2020 - A Practical Guide Course List

It's that time of year again, and Brad Traversy has released his Web Development roadmap for the upcoming year. It is a fantastic resource that I know we are all thankful for. And being a web developer has never been better, and as shown in the video there are a **TON** of technologies at our disposal! But, that can also be rather intimidating for newcomers. So I have comprised a list below of the top Udemy courses for each slide as well for other resources, as much as possible, hopefully easing your decision making. Each block of courses are listed in alphabetical order for simplicity's sake.

As Brad mentions in the video, you certainly **DO NOT** need to learn everything here. He is just providing you with the options of what you _CAN_ learn (and somethings you _SHOULD_ learn - such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript), and he explains what these technologies are. So, it really is up to you what you want to learn.

**[Watch the video here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pThnRneDjw)**

And of course there are many other interesting and very good learning platforms besides Udemy, but it's the platform I am personally most familiar with and I think (??) is one of the most popular, so that's what I am going with. So without further ado, let's get learning!

But first, if Udemy's not your jam, no worries! There are plenty of other sites to learn from, some of which I've listed below:

## UI/UX

- [User Experience Design Essentials - Adobe XD UI UX Design](https://www.udemy.com/course/ui-ux-web-design-using-adobe-xd/) by Daniel Walter Scott _(93 lectures / 11.5hrs)_

Now while it is true that once you work on a team/for a company, there is very likely going to be a UI/UX Designer, and you will focus on the development aspect of that project. But having even a bit of experience under your belt and a keen eye for design can be greatly beneficial, especially if you want to work as a Front-End Developer. The course above by Daniel Walter Scott is perfect for just that. He walks you through the entire processing of being a UI/UX Designer, and you get to use Adobe XD, which is a completely free and fantastic wireframing/design tool.

Wow, that is a **_LOT_** to learn! 2020 is looking to be an amazing time to learn about web development, and far more than that too.

But wait, there's **MORE!!**

_gasps_

Udemy is also well known for having all-in-one full stack web development courses, as well as more recently full stack courses with specific technologies, such as MERN, MEAN, and recently MEVN. These 3 all use the same 3 letters: M, E, & N which stand for MongoDB, Express, and Node. The key difference between them is which JavaScript library/framework they use. MERN uses React, MEAN uses Angular, and MEVN uses Vue. You can find courses for these listed below.

Also below are courses for Data Structures & Algorithms, as well as interview prep. JavaScript interviews, especially at large companies like Google, Amazon, Apple, Facebook, etc., are infamous for their whiteboard coding challenges. Below are some of the top courses for Data Structures & Algorithms for JavaScript to help you ace your next interview.

And finally, testing, or Test-Driven Development (TDD). TDD is actually quite important, so knowing how to test your code will be huge boost to your resume/skill set and set you apart from other candidates when you start applying for jobs.
