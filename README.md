# Web Development Course List

Once again, it's that time of year and Brad Traversy has just released his latest Web Development roadmap for the upcoming year. This is an amazing resource that we all appreciate. As a web developer, we have access to an incredible amount of technologies as shown in the video, but this can be overwhelming for beginners. To help with this, I have curated a list below of the top Udemy courses for each topic slide as well as some other resources to make your decision-making process easier. The courses are listed in alphabetical order for simplicity. With these resources, you can gain the knowledge and skills needed to thrive in the world of web development..

You certainly **DO NOT** need to learn everything here. This list aims to simply provide you with the options of what you _CAN_ learn (and some things you _SHOULD_ learn - such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript). So, it really is up to you what you want to learn.

**[Watch the video here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfGW0Qiy2I0)**

And of course, there are other learning platforms besides Udemy. But it's the platform I am personally most familiar with and I think one of the most popular, so that's what I am going with. So, without further ado, let's get learning!

If Udemy's not your jam though, no worries! There are plenty of other resources to learn about web development from, some of which I've listed below:

Wow, that is a **_LOT_** to learn! 2021 is looking to be an amazing time to learn all there is about web development, and far more than that too.

But wait, there's even **MORE!!**

Udemy is also well known for having all-in-one full stack web development courses, as well as more recently full stack courses with specific technologies, such as MERN, MEAN, and recently MEVN. These 3 all use the same 3 letters: M, E, & N which stand for MongoDB, Express, and Node. The key difference between them is which JavaScript library/framework they use on the front end. MERN uses React, MEAN uses Angular, and MEVN uses Vue.
